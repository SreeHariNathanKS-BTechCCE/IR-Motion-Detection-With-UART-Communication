# IR-Motion-Detection-With-UART-Communication
The aim is to utilize a IR sensor for motion detection. Whenever motion is detected by the sensor, The following actions will be implemented:
1.  Blink a red LED: Upon motion detection, a red LED connected to the microcontroller will be blinked to
provide a visual indication of the detected motion.
2. Notify "Motion Detected" message: In addition to the LED blinking, a notification or a message such as
"Motion Detected" will be sent to provide an alert about the presence of motion.
Inference:

The system successfully detects motion, provides real-time feedback through UART communication, and
controls an LED for visual indication. The project showcases the versatility and processing power of the MSP432
microcontroller and its potential for various applications in security, automation, and occupancy monitoring.
Conclusion:

In conclusion, the motion detection system implemented with a IR sensor and MSP432 microcontroller provides
a reliable and efficient solution for detecting motion in a given environment. The IR sensor detects changes in
infrared radiation caused by motion, allowing the system to identify the presence of a moving object.
By utilizing the capabilities of the MSP432 microcontroller, the system can process the sensor output and make
decisions based on the detected motion. In this case, the system uses UART communication to print a message
("Motion detected") when motion is detected, and it controls an LED to provide a visual indication
